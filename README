Features
Input form to add expenses (amount, category, date).
Store and manage expense data in a CSV file or SQLite database.
Visualize spending habits using graphs and charts.
Predict future expenses using least squares regression.
Technologies Used
Python
Flask (or Tkinter for desktop applications)
Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
NumPy (for numerical computations)
SQLite (optional, for database storage)
Installation
Clone the repository.
Install the required packages.
Usage
Run the application.
Access the application in your web browser.
Use the input form to log your expenses, and navigate to the visualization section to view your spending habits.
How It Works
Data Entry: Users input expenses, which are stored in a CSV file or database.
Visualization: The application generates visualizations (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs) to provide insights into spending categories.
Prediction: Uses least squares optimization to fit a linear model to historical expense data, predicting future expenses based on trends.
